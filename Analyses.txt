Pupil sizes
The right pupil of the participants was recorded at a rate of 1000Hz using an SR Research EyeLink 1000 eye-tracker. After discarding error trials and trials in which pupil size values deviated more than 2.5 SD from the mean (fro each participant in each condition), a pupil size measure was calculated by averaging across the 10-sec trial resulting in an individual measure per trial (and per participant).
Removed participants: n=2, due to the fact that their mean pupil size in both conditions deviated more than 2.5SD from the population means. 
Emotional ratings
After each sentence, instructions appeared asking participants to rate on a 1-to-7 scale the emotional impact of the sentence (1=low, neutral impact; 7=high, negative impact). These instructions were given in the language in which the experimental session was conducted. Emotional impact ratings were collected by pressing the appropriate button on a response box with 7 labelled buttons located in front of them at a comfortable distance 

The data were analyzed using R and the R packages lme4 afex. Pupil sizes and emotional ratings were both analyzed with a linear mixed effects model with language and emotion as fixed effects including their interaction, as well as averaged ratings of semantic composability (obtained in a norming study) as covariate. Fixed effects were sum-to-zero coded. Participant and item were included as random intercepts, and a random slope for emotion by participant was also included.
